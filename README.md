A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

That's a good start, but a professional README.md should be much more detailed and structured, especially for an application that manages DVR/NVR systems, storage configuration, and complex alerts.

Here is a significantly enhanced and detailed README.md based on the features you described, formatted for maximum clarity and informational value.
